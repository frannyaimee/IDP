>Start Date of Project: March 13th, 2019
>Status: In-Progress
>This is our first big group project given to us by the coaches of BeCode. We are creating a website for a company, there have to be a minimum of 4 pages. The (bonus) instructions are to create the page in parallex, so we are attempting to go ahead and create the website in this format. We are seperately each creating a page based on the agreed-upon Parallex theme and colors and will be combining the pages upon completion. 
>This website is a website for a plumber, the four different pages we are creating are: home, contact, services, and projects. 

>>Installation:
>No installation needed, we will be using Sublime Text and Visual Studio as our text editors. All code is written in HTML and CSS. This project is currently still in progress.
