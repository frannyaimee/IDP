## Context

This is our first big group project given to us by the coaches of BeCode. We are creating a website for a company, there have to be a minimum of 4 pages. The (bonus) instructions are to create the page in parallax, so we are attempting to go ahead and create the website from the start in this format. We are seperately each creating a portion of the parallax based on an agreed template and will be combining the pages and implementing final styling upon completion. 

This website is a website for a plumber, the four different pages/sections we are creating are: home, contact, services, and projects.
