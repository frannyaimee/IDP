## Context

This is our first big group project given to us by the coaches of BeCode. We are creating a website for a company, there have to be a minimum of 4 pages. The (bonus) instructions are to create the page in parallax, so we are attempting to go ahead and create the website from the start in this format. We are seperately each creating a portion of the parallax based on an agreed template and will be combining the pages and implementing final styling upon completion. 

This website is a website for a plumber, the four different pages/sections we are creating are: home, contact, services, and projects. 

## Instructions
* Invent a company together and think of four pages that the company needs.
* Divide those pages amongst the group and each design one page.
* Once you are all finished, join those pages together into one page (page below page)
* Publish the result with a github repository (call it name-of-your-business)
* Make sure everyone in the group has a repository of the website
* Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there

## Bonus Objectives
* Add a parallax image header Example
* Add google maps pinned on the location of your company somewhere on the onepager
* Try to make your website responsive (if you haven't already)
* Mention your phone number somewhere on the onepager, if you click it should (try to) call you
